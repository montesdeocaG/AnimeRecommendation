Hi, 

This repository is an **Anime Recommendation System (A.R.S)** based on _Python 3.7_.
The dataset used for the Recommendation System is available at Kaggle in the following link: 

_https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist/version/5#anime_filtered.csv_

The **Python libraries** used for this project are:

(For the base of the code):
  
    -Pandas
    
(For data visualization in the development of the code):
  
    -Seaborn
    -Matplotlib.pyplot
    -Numpy
    
Additionally, this Recomendation System will be adapted for automatized and adapted for Discord Bot.
The code corresponding to the base of the bot is available in the **master** branch; however, due to incompatibility of the library _Discord.py_ with _Python 3.7_, it is based on _Python 3.6_. 


Discord.py documentation: _https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_


The **A.R.S** is being developed in Jupyter Notebook, while the Discord Bot in PyCharm Community Edition.
